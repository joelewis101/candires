# Candires

This is a repo to share my analysis of the candires data. For data protection 
reasons, no data are stored here, nor any output of the analysis. The analysis 
code is R code which contained in quarto documents.

Details on quarto are available [here](https://quarto.org/) - it's similar to 
Rmarkdown and can be used to render the code and analysis and plain text to a 
document. It's supported by Rstudio or can be run from the command line.

The code assumes that the data is in a folder `data_raw` - filenames should be 
self-explanatory from the code.
